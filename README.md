## What is LogicBuilder?

LogicBuilder is a simulator for logic circuits that runs in your browser. It features a wide range of components as well as other electronic hardware. This tool is meant to be used by both for beginners for learning and professionals for prototyping.

## Features

 * Use basic components to create complex circuits
 * Create your own components and save them for further use
 * Avoid frying your components by testing your circuits and find errors
 * Learn about electronic circuits by using the **Beginner mode**
 * Use real world retail hardware in your circuits and program them virtually
 * Use your smartphone to interact with your virtual hardware

## Beginner mode

Follow tutorials to learn how to create logic gates and other complex circuits. Once you have unlocked a logic gate you can use it to create even more complex things. In beginner mode the circuits are simplified. You don't have to care about voltage or current so your components won't fry.

## Professional mode

In professional mode things work as they do in real life. The components interact with each other based on electrical voltage and current. Components will fry if you are not careful. You have access to all available components and hardware without having to unlock them.

## Instructions

Move around the grid by pressing down your mouse and dragging it. Zoom in and out using the mousewheel. Drag components from the tool panel and drop them on the grid. Click on the **Connect** button to draw wires on the grid. Press the **Run** button to start the simulation.
